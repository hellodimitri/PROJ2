This repository is for Project 2 of UPP 465 at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Welcome!

These files describe the placement of Chicago's assisted living facilites that have on-site community gardens and city-recognized urban farms. Their placement begins to illustrate a story of how elderly populations have or do not have access to natural environments that are community-oriented, participatory, and offers the chance for cultivation.

The data is sourced from a repository of community gardens, urban farms, and more green spaces monitored by the Chicago Urban Agriculture Mapping Project (CUAMP), which allows for self-reported information. CUAMP data is available to the public without restriction, including the manipulation and preparation of it. 

Data for this map and this project was archived in December of 2020 and prepared in-house by the repository owner.
