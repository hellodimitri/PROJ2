	<h2 class="subtitle1">Where Urban Farming influences Assisted Living.</h2></div>

<div> 
	<p class="bodytext">Vulnerable populations are, oftentimes, spatially excluded from accessing participatory natural environments. Such amenities, like community gardens and urban farms, benefit communities holistically, by providing local food sources, collective public spaces, and serve as green interruptions on a gray landscape. 
	<br><br>
	In Chicago, the City in a Garden may still be inaccessible for populations with restricted movement. The city’s elderly populations, now about 12% of the total share, are limited by their diverse mobility to enjoy parts of Chicago that non-aging-into-disability populations access frequently.  Open spaces with community gardens, like those along the lakeshore parks, may be too far and complicated to reach for elderly Chicagoans in the interior. 
	<br><br>
	However, pockets of the cultivated world exist in select assisted living facilities. Themselves privileged places—because of the family expenses needed for assisted living—they still connect older residents to natural environments in which food production, environmental health, and holistic wellbeing are more accessible.
	<br><br>
	This map displays the assisted living facilities in Chicago that have on-site community gardens for their residents and their families to use. This map also shows the location of City-recognized urban farms.

	<p class="bodytext"> This dataset is sourced from the Chicago Urban Agriculture Mapping Project and is from December 2020. Features information on point data is self-reported by community members, garden managers, assisted living directors, and the Chicago Parks District. The data is publicly available and reproducible. Data preparation, geocoding, and classification was done in-house. This project is for a University of Illinois at Chicago summer course.
	<br><br>
	Community gardens are classified by if the garden is currently active. Non-active gardens are shown in black. Active gardens are shown in green.
	<br><br>
	Urban farms are classified by the type of community participation. Urban farms that distribute parcels through allotment are shown in orange. Urban farms with other methods of parcel distribution are shown in yellow.
	<br><br>
	Some gardens and urban farms have additional features, identified in the pop-up. Certain community gardens include mention of interesting on-site structures. Certain urban farms include mention of a water source. Note that not all gardens and urban farms include this information in their reporting.
